# Maria Samantha “Missy” Gehring  
### Mission-Critical Program Architect  
*Defense • Intelligence • Infrastructure • Platform Delivery*

I design and operate delivery systems for complex, high-stakes environments—where technology, construction, security, and operations must align precisely for the mission to succeed.

Across defense, intelligence, federal healthcare, and international infrastructure programs, I’ve been trusted to bring order to ambiguity: turning fragmented requirements, competing constraints, and global dependencies into predictable, executable delivery engines.

This repository serves as a temporary portfolio hub while a full website is under development.

## Executive Value Proposition

- **Mission-critical delivery at scale:** Led modernization, verification, and readiness programs supporting 1,600+ users across defense, intelligence, healthcare, and international regulatory environments.
- **Cross-domain orchestration:** Integrated software, cybersecurity, construction, data, and operations into unified delivery systems leadership could trust.
- **Risk-informed execution:** Built governance, scheduling, and decision platforms that reduced delivery cycles by up to 55% while strengthening auditability and continuity.
- **Global deployment leadership:** Executed programs in austere, regulated, and politically complex environments (Austria, Afghanistan, Sudan, UAE, United States).
- **Systems people actually use:** Designed “happy-path” processes, training frameworks, and automation that improved adoption, accuracy, and execution velocity.
