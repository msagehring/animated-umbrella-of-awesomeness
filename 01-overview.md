# Maria Samantha “Missy” Gehring  
### Mission-Critical Program Architect  
*Defense • Intelligence • Infrastructure • Platform Delivery*

I design and operate delivery systems for complex, high-stakes environments—where technology, construction, security, and operations must align precisely for the mission to succeed.

Across defense, intelligence, federal healthcare, and international infrastructure programs, I’ve been trusted to bring order to ambiguity: turning fragmented requirements, competing constraints, and global dependencies into predictable, executable delivery engines.

## What I Do

I specialize in **program orchestration at the point where complexity breaks most organizations**—modernization efforts that span platforms, facilities, cybersecurity, governance, and real-world operations.

I don’t just manage initiatives. I design the systems that make execution reliable:
- governance models leadership can trust  
- schedules that reflect reality, not theory  
- workflows teams actually adopt  
- metrics that reveal risk early, not after failure

## Executive Value Proposition

- **Mission-critical delivery at scale:** Led modernization, verification, and readiness programs supporting **1,600+ users** across defense, intelligence, healthcare, and international regulatory environments.
- **Cross-domain orchestration:** Integrated software, cybersecurity, construction, data, and operations into unified delivery systems across global teams.
- **Risk-informed execution:** Built governance, scheduling, and decision platforms that reduced delivery cycles by up to **55%** while strengthening auditability and continuity.
- **Global deployment leadership:** Executed programs in austere, regulated, and politically complex environments (Austria, Afghanistan, Sudan, UAE, United States).
- **Systems people actually use:** Designed “happy-path” processes, training frameworks, and automation that improved adoption, accuracy, and execution velocity.
